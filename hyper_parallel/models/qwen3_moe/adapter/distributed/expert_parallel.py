"""expert_parallel: the Qwen3-MoE EP compute archetype factory.

Migrated from ``distributed/expert_parallel/recipes.py`` in M3 (adjust doc
§5.1/§5.4): only the Qwen-specific router contract (``TopKRouter`` module
returning ``(logits, scores, indices)``, no shared expert) sinks into the
model adapter. The combine skeleton, the router-adapter registry and the
dispatch/collective primitives stay in the generic
``auto_models/distributed/expert_parallel`` layer; this factory composes
them through the now-public ``build_ep_compute``.
